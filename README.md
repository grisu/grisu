Grisu
=====
 
Grisu is an open source framework to help grid admins and developers to support end users in a grid environment. Grisu publishes an easy-to-use service interface which by default sits behind a web service. This service interface contains a set of methods that are usually needed to submit jobs to the grid, including providing information about the grid and the staging of input/output files from/to the users desktop.

Grisu-core
=========

This is the main package of the Grisu framework. It is written entirely in Java and contains the backend compoent (**/backend/grisu-core**), a frontend library (**/frontend/grisu-client** and **/frontend/grisu-client-swing**) and a **grisu-common** which contains shared code of both components.
