Grisu
=====

_Grisu_ is an open source framework intended to sit on top of grid middleware in order to make development of user/workflow/application specific clients for grid resources as easy as possible. _Grisu_ also comes with two implementations of general purpose grid clients, one commandline based called [griclish](https://github.com/grisu/gricli), the other one a desktop gui application called the _Grisu Template client_:

_Grisu_ is written in Java and is split up in a [backend](https://github.com/grisu/grisu/wiki/Backend) and a [frontend] (https://github.com/grisu/grisu/wiki/Frontpage) part. The connection between those two parts is done via an API, which is implemented in a class called [ServiceInterface](https://github.com/grisu/grisu/wiki/ServiceInterface).
 
Grisu is an open source framework to help grid admins and developers to support end users in a grid environment. Grisu publishes an easy-to-use service interface which by default sits behind a web service. This service interface contains a set of methods that are usually needed to submit jobs to the grid, including providing information about the grid and the staging of input/output files from/to the users desktop.

Grisu-core
=========

This is the main package of the Grisu framework. It is written entirely in Java and contains the backend compoent (**/backend/grisu-core**), a frontend library (**/frontend/grisu-client** and **/frontend/grisu-client-swing**) and a **grisu-common** which contains shared code of both components.
