	<!-- 	Only the "Common" module is used here. It is recommended that you always
		use the "Common" module because it is very unintuitive if the parameters 
		it encapsulates have to be put in by hand. These parameters are:
		* Jobname
		* Walltime
		* CPUs
		* HostName
		* ExecutionFileSystem
		* EmailAddress 
		
		When using a module, you have to use which so called template nodes are used 
		by it. And you have to know what names the module expects for these nodes.
		If one or more of these names are not available in the template, the module is 
		not used at all and all the template nodes that it normally would use are
		given to the "Rest" module, which is automatically created everytime one or
		more template nodes of a template are not claimed by a module.
