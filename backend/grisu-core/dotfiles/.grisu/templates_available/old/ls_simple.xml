	<!-- 	Only the "Common" module is used here. It is recommended that you always
	   		use the "Common" module because it is very unintuitive if the parameters 
	   		it encapsulates have to be put in by hand. These parameters are:
	   			* Jobname
				* Walltime
				* CPUs
				* HostName
				* ExecutionFileSystem
				* EmailAddress 
						
			When using a module, you have to use which so called template nodes are used 
			by it. And you have to know what names the module expects for these nodes.
			If one or more of these names are not available in the template, the module is 
			not used at all and all the template nodes that it normally would use are
			given to the "Rest" module, which is automatically created everytime one or
			more template nodes of a template are not claimed by a module.
